# Brain_stroke_Prediction using MRI images
# In this project we are used Python for backend and Html and Css for Front-end
# Dataset which contain mri images . We are seperated that images into three parts Test(15%) , Train(15%) and Validation(70%).
# We are Selected MobileNet DL Model.Train the model with that dataset.
# We got 94.27% accuracy with the model.
# 96 out 100 images .The model predict Correctly.
